# Truthed Professional

**⚡ Status: MVP Complete and Demo-Ready**

A sophisticated content verification platform designed for academic research, journalism education, and professional fact-checking. Truthed Professional provides transparent, explainable analysis of online content credibility through advanced NLP and machine learning.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**"Content Verification as a Service"** - Truthed Professional combines claim extraction, source credibility analysis, and fact verification to provide educational explanations about content reliability. Rather than simple binary judgments, it offers detailed analysis of why content may be unreliable.

### ✅ Core Capabilities (Working MVP)
- **🎯 Claim Extraction**: BERT-based NLP identifies factual claims in articles
- **📰 Source Analysis**: Evaluates domain credibility across 200+ sources  
- **🔍 Fact Verification**: Assesses claim verifiability and evidence quality
- **📊 Ensemble Scoring**: Combines multiple signals for overall credibility assessment
- **🌐 Web Interface**: Professional web application for content analysis
- **🔌 API Access**: RESTful API for programmatic integration

## 🚀 Quick Start
